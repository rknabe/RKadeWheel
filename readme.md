# RKade Wheel

Modified fork of vsulako/AFFBWheel, adapted for Happ/Midway original belt-driven arcade wheel and motor for use with Windows-based multi-cabs (Cruisin Exotica and NFS cabs in my case).
So far, this works with some older and newer PC Games with FFB, Teknoparrot, mame, demul, M2, SuperModel3, Flycast and other emulators supported by FFBArcadePlugin (https://github.com/Boomslangnz/FFBArcadePlugin/releases).
